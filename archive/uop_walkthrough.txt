Sit tight – this is a bit complex.  I think I should have done it in a Word document!!!

 

As promised, some thoughts as to how to use the unit_of_presentation table to generate correct NTPs and the extra MPs we need (the “pseudoDINs”).

 

This was the one thing I don’t think we properly bottomed out during our Ottawa meetings was presentation strength.  The only way I can see of getting presentation strength correctly and relatively simply is to make an addition to the agreed structure of unit_of_presentation table.  I have added a “calculation” column; if that has a “Y” then a calculation to get presentation strength is needed; if it is a “N” then concentration strength should be used (because not all products need a presentation strength (the insulins being the classic)). 

 

And sorry – I’ve got a bit confused by the table names now; I think what was being called the ingredient_strength table is now ccdd_drug_ingredients_raw – I hope that is correct.

 

I’ll try to explain by working through some examples:

 

EXAMPLE 1: A simple liquid injectable product with a concentration strength in the DPD needing presentation strength in the CCDD

 

In the ccdd_drug_ingredients_raw table, there will be an entry for a liquid injectable product with a concentration strength thus:

 

Row 6600: drug_code = 69271 has an mp_ingredient_name of “amiodarone hydrochloride 50 mg per mL” built up from the ingredient description and the “strength - strength_unit – dosage_value – dosage_unit” (where if the dosage_value is null, assume unitary)

 

But we actually need for that product is amiodarone hydrochloride 150 mg per 3 mL vial

 

SO: We need to know that the product comes in a 3 mL vial, and that a calculation is required on the concentration strength.  

 

Following on from where we got to with ingredient/strength for each drug_code (and noting that for all of that we’ve been dealing with single ingredient/strength pairs) and following that the dosage form would be added in to give produce the basic ntp_formal_name….we then introduce the unit_of_presentation table thus: 

 

If the MP has a drug_code present in the unit_of_presentation table we need to do something.  Our product does have a single entry:

 

drug_code
 unit_of_presentation
 uop_size
 uop_unit_of_measure
 calculation
 
69271
 vial
 3
 mL
 Y
 

 

And it has a Y in the calculation column

SO: 

1)      Take all four values of the concentration strength from ccdd_drug_ingredients_raw [“strength - strength_unit – dosage_value – dosage_unit” ] and the two unit of presentation values from the unit_of_presentation table [uop_size – uop_unit_of_measure].  

2)      Check that dosage_unit = uop_unit_of_measure  - if it doesn’t we have a problem and we need an exception report

3)      Multiply <<ccdd_drug_ingredients_raw strength>> value by <<unit_of_presentation uop_size>> value to give the presentation strength value

4)      Append the <<ccdd_drug_ingredients_raw strength_unit>>

5)      Append the <<unit_of_presentation uop_size>> value after a “per”

6)      Append the <<unit_of_presentation uop_unit_of_measure>> 

7)      Append the <<unit_of_presentation unit of presentation>> after the dosage form

 

Which, for this product is:

1)      50 mg per () mL   and  3 mL

2)      Yes – both units are mL

3)      50 x 3 = 150

4)      150 mg

5)      150 mg per 3

6)      150 mg per 3 mL

7)      Xxxx solution for injection vial

 

For the full ntp_formal_name, the dosage form goes next (for this product, solution for injection) then the unit of presentation itself goes at the end – in this case “vial” – to give a full ntp of amiodarone hydrochloride 150 mg per 3 mL solution for injection vial

 

And when we put that into the mp_formal_name, we get AMIODARONE HYDROCHLORIDE INJECTION (amiodarone hydrochloride 150 mg per 3 mL solution for injection vial) FRESENIUS KABI CANADA LTD [DIN 02245248]

 

EXAMPLE 2: A simple liquid injectable product with a concentration strength in the DPD needing presentation strength in the CCDD (different unit of presentation)

 

The same process, but this product is presented in a syringe, not a vial – a crucial difference when prescribing, so needs a separate NTP

 

Row 14135, drug_code = 86000; data in the ccdd_drug_ingredients_raw table is the same as in the example above, but in the unit_of_presentation table we have this:

 

drug_code
 unit_of_presentation
 uop_size
 uop_unit_of_measure
 calculation
 
69271
 syringe
 3
 mL
 Y
 

 

So, for this product, the steps give

 

1)      50 mg per () mL   and  3 mL

2)      Yes – both units are mL

3)      50 x 3 = 150

4)      150 mg

5)      150 mg per 3

6)      150 mg per 3 mL

7)      Xxxx solution for injection syringe

 

The full ntp_formal_name is amiodarone hydrochloride 150 mg per 3 mL solution for injection syringe mp_formal_name, we get AMIODARONE SYRINGE (amiodarone hydrochloride 150 mg per 3 mL solution for injection vial) SANDOZ CANADA INCORPORATED [DIN 02374684] 

 

EXAMPLE 3: A liquid injectable product with a concentration strength in the DPD needing presentation strength in the CCDD AND needing “pseudo-DINs”

I’ve worked this example with another amiodarone product, to keep the thread, but it’s exactly the same process for the nebuliser solutions in the unit dose vials

 

In the ccdd_drug_ingredients_raw table, there will be a single entry for a liquid injectable product with a concentration strength thus:

 

Row 6936: drug_code = 71180 which again has an mp_ingredient_name of “amiodarone hydrochloride 50 mg per mL” built up from the ingredient description and the “strength - strength_unit – dosage_value – dosage_unit” (where if the dosage_value is null, assume unitary)

 

But we actually need for this product is amiodarone hydrochloride 150 mg per 3 mL vial AND amiodarone hydrochloride 900 mg per 18 mL 

 

SO, in the unit_of_presentation table we find there are two entries for that drug_code:

 

drug_code
 unit_of_presentation
 uop_size
 uop_unit_of_measure
 calculation
 
71180
 vial
 3
 mL
 Y
 
71180
 vial
 18
 mL
 Y
 

 

This means that we will be creating two NTPs and two MPs.  The two MPs will need pseudoDINs.

 

We run the calculation process twice:

 

 

1)      50 mg per () mL   and  3 mL

2)      Yes – both units are mL

3)      50 x 3 = 150

4)      150 mg

5)      150 mg per 3

6)      150 mg per 3 mL

7)      Xxxx solution for injection vial

 
  

8)      50 mg per () mL   and  18 mL

9)      Yes – both units are mL

10)   50 x 18 = 900

11)   900 mg

12)   900 mg per 18

13)   900 mg per 18 mL

14)   Xxxx solution for injection vial

 
 

 

So we get two NTPs with ntp_formal_name as follows:

 

Ø  amiodarone hydrochloride 150 mg per 3 mL solution for injection vial

Ø  amiodarone hydrochloride 900 mg per 18 mL solution for injection vial

 

And two MPs with mp_formal_name as follows:

 

Ø  AMIODARONE FOR INJECTION 50MG/ML (amiodarone hydrochloride 150 mg per 3 mL solution for injection vial ) TEVA CANADA LIMITED

Ø  AMIODARONE FOR INJECTION 50MG/ML (amiodarone hydrochloride 150 mg per 3 mL solution for injection vial )TEVA CANADA LIMITED

 

Both these MPs map to DIN 02246953 so they need entries in the MP to DIN mapping table.

 

EXAMPLE 4: Liquid injectable products with a concentration strength in the DPD and the CCDD but needing unit of presentation information 

These are insulin examples, and don’t need pseudoDINs; some insulin products would need pseudoDINs – use extra logic as in Example 3

 

Example 4A

In the ccdd_drug_ingredients_raw table, there will be an entry for a liquid injectable product with a concentration strength thus:

 

Row 6689: drug_code = 69790 has an mp_ingredient_name of “insulin glargine 100 unit per mL” built up from the ingredient description and the “strength - strength_unit – dosage_value – dosage_unit” (where if the dosage_value is null, assume unitary)

 

In the unit_of_presentation table we have this:

 

drug_code
 unit_of_presentation
 uop_size
 uop_unit_of_measure
 calculation
 
69790
 vial
 10
 mL
 N
 

 

There’s a “N” in the calculation column, so we don’t need a calculation of presentation strength, we will use the concentration strength that is given in the ccdd_drug_ingredients_raw table (100 unit per mL)

 

But we do need the unit of presentation and its size, 

SO we need to take the data from the relevant row in the unit_of_presentation table and append it to the NTP to give the full ntp_formal_name:

 

Ø  insulin glargine 100 unit per mL solution for injection 10 mL vial

 

And this gives us the MP concept thus: 

 

Ø  LANTUS (insulin glargine 100 unit per mL solution for injection 10 mL vial) SANOFI-AVENTIS CANADA INC [DIN 02245689]

 

Example 4B

In the ccdd_drug_ingredients_raw table, there will be an entry for a liquid injectable product with a concentration strength thus:

 

Row 7669: drug_code = 73683 has the same mp_ingredient_name as in Example 4A above: “insulin glargine 100 unit per mL” built up from the ingredient description and the “strength - strength_unit – dosage_value – dosage_unit” (where if the dosage_value is null, assume unitary)

 

In the unit_of_presentation table we have this:

 

drug_code
 unit_of_presentation
 uop_size
 uop_unit_of_measure
 calculation
 
73683
 cartridge
 3
 mL
 N
 

 

There’s a “N” in the calculation column, so we don’t need a calculation of presentation strength, we will use the concentration strength that is given in the ccdd_drug_ingredients_raw table (100 unit per mL)

 

But we do need the unit of presentation and its size, 

SO we need to take the data from the relevant row in the unit_of_presentation table and append it to the NTP to give the full ntp_formal_name – thereby showing that this is a separate NTP, even though the strength and dosage form are the same as in Example 4A:

 

Ø  insulin glargine 100 unit per mL solution for injection 3 mL cartridge

 

And this gives us a unique name for the MP concept thus: 

 

Ø  LANTUS (insulin glargine 100 unit per mL solution for injection 3 mL cartridge) SANOFI-AVENTIS CANADA INC [DIN 02251930]

 

Well, if you’ve worked your way through all of that, well done.  My brain has fried today!  But I think this will work.  

 

The critical thing then will be to be able to build you that unit_of_presentation table in time.  If you think this is going to work, I’ll go all guns to get that built; I think I have almost all of the data for the Top 250in various spreadsheets from the original QA process, I (just) need to get it into this format for you.  Let me know ASAP, please.
